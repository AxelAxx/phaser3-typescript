# 2D Ray casting

## History

- The term ray casting was first used in computer graphics in a 1982 paper by Scott Roth to describe a method for rendering constructive solid geometry models
- The first ray casting algorithm used for rendering was presented by Arthur Appel in 1968

## Random notes

- Use of the geometric algorithm of ray tracing
- Any combination of three things might happen with a light ray: absorption, reflection, and refraction
- Ray casting can be used for field of vision:
