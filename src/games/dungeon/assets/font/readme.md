# Acorn BBC Micro (1981)

The Beeb, as it was affectionately known, has its own font which could display
in three different modes – one wider and one narrower but many users might not 
recognize it all as it booted into ‘Mode 7’ utilizing a Videotex chip
(used in the UK for text-on-TV and travel agents as well as in France for Minitel)
that had a different font of its own.

## Unusual characteristics

- Drops bold in tight spaces e.g ‘$&@’
- Outlines the tail on the ‘Q’ to make it much clearer
- Unique and beautiful ‘*’
- Does not extend low bar on ‘e’ as much as expected and ‘f’ seems to wide
- Vertically squished ‘?’
- Style of single-quote ‘ is inconsistent with comma

## Specifications

- STYLE Bold sans
- WIDTH 4-7 pixels
- CAPS 7 pixels
- CHARSET ASCII only

## Influences

It’s quite likely it was influenced by the Atari 8-bit font but with larger
capitals and ascenders and a much more consistent look.
